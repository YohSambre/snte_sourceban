# snte_sourceban
complete file of all users who tried to exploit on servers hosted at mtxserv.com

initially mtxserv.com had set up a website with databases related to garrysmod game servers, Seb one of the cofounder of mtxserv had set up a page dedicated to all SNTE banns registered on all machines equipped with the addon workshop.

Unfortunately the site has closed for lack of investment, however I managed to recover in .json format the entire list of people banned on mtxserv.com machines, it is now time to show it publicly.

Maybe an operation like this will happen again or maybe not, only the future will tell us. If you have tried to cheat on gmod servers in the last 5 years of SNTE existence try to find your steamid in this massive list

good luck!
